Run phase balance test monthly.\n\nFull replacement recommended after 20,000 hours of operation or at first sign of repeated fault cycling within 72 hours.\n\n## Replacement Procedure - Certified Technician Protocol\n\n1. Initiate full turbine shutdown and engage E-Stop mode from SCADA. Confirm complete grid disconnection before accessing the cabinet.\n\n2. Wait 15 minutes to allow capacitor discharge. Confirm zero voltage using a CAT IV-rated multimeter across input/output terminals.\n\n3. Open the inverter bay cabinet (typically section C1) using a keyed access panel. Use an anti-static strap before touching internal components.\n\n4. Visually inspect the IMX-3100 unit for burn marks, bulging capacitors, or debris. Document any visual abnormalities.\n\n5. Disconnect the main AC input, output, and DC bus connectors. Use torque-controlled insulated tools. Tag all cables.\n\n6. Unplug sensor connectors for sensor_A, sensor_E, sensor_H, and sensor_K. Confirm pins are not oxidized or bent.\n\n7. Remove the unit from the rack using two personnel. Weight exceeds 21kg; use shoulder harness or crane winch for safety.\n8. Inspect rear mounting points and rails for corrosion or deformation. Clean using industrial-grade contact cleaner and corrosion inhibitor.\n\n9.

Clean transducers and check SCADA for signal dropouts.\n\n## ANA-011\nDescription: Direction offset >25° compared to turbine yaw alignment.\nResolution: Recalibrate sensor_D. Confirm sensor is level and properly aligned to turbine nose.\n\n## ANA-026\nDescription: Temperature compensation failure - signal drift at low temperatures.\nResolution: Run temperature compensation test. Replace if internal thermal correction fails diagnostic.\n\n## ANA-034\nDescription: Sensor communication timeout with SCADA bus.\nResolution: Verify cabling and connector integrity. Replace cable or power injector if voltage is unstable.\n\n## ANA-045\nDescription: Ultrasonic echo quality below threshold.\nResolution: Clean all transducer heads with alcohol wipe. If problem persists, replace sensor head module.\n\n## ANA-063\nDescription: Internal tilt detected >10° for over 5 minutes.\nResolution: Check sensor mounting plate and bolts. Realign or remount to eliminate tilt.\n\n## ANA-078\nDescription: Wind speed fluctuation >80% in 3 seconds (false gust detected).\nResolution: Check for reflective obstruction near sensor. Apply gust filtering in SCADA settings if terrain-dependent.\n\n# Service Interval and Calibration Policy\n\nClean transducers every 4 months. Recalibrate direction alignment annually or after SCADA drift alerts. Replace sensor every 4 years or on drift/echo failure.\n\n## Safe Replacement and Alignment Workflow\n\n1. Deactivate turbine yaw movement. Confirm safe roof access and nacelle lockout.\n2. Climb to nacelle rooftop and secure PPE harness. Identify ANA-750 mount near weather station pole.\n3. Disconnect signal cable from sensor base. Shield connector with protective cap.\n4. Unfasten mounting screws (usually 4 mm Allen head) and gently lift sensor off mount.\n5. Inspect sensor body and transducer heads for contamination, insect ingress, or damage.\n6. Install new WindCore ANA-750, ensuring exact north-facing alignment for accurate direction data.\n7. Tighten mounting screws evenly to avoid tilt. Use digital level if needed.\n8. Reconnect signal cable. Check for corrosion or wear on contacts before securing.\n9. Return to SCADA interface and check for live wind speed and direction telemetry.\n10. Run self-test and verify echo quality, internal temperature, and tilt angle are nominal.\n11. Simulate wind changes (if possible) or wait for natural variance to validate response.\n12. Log replacement timestamp, sensor serial, and telemetry readings at install.\n13. Photograph mount position and attach to service record for traceability.\n14. Re-enable yaw control and monitor 1-hour wind tracking session for anomalies."

Ensure the turbine is fully powered down and isolated from the electrical grid. Confirm lock-out tag is applied at the master circuit breaker.\n\n2. Use a grounding strap to prevent electrostatic discharge before accessing internal components.\n\n3. Open the main nacelle housing and locate the controller tray marked CC2-TRAY. This is typically beneath the SCADA interface block.\n\n4. Unplug all sensor connectors (labelled S-A through S-F) from the controller. Mark each with color-coded tape for easy reconnection.\n\n5. Use a T25 screwdriver to unscrew all mounting screws along the perimeter of the controller card.\n\n6. Gently slide the card out of its PCI-style connector. Examine edge connectors for black marks or corrosion.\n\n7. Use a brush and isopropyl alcohol to clean the connector interface and fan blades within the tray.\n\n8. Insert the new 'WindSync ControlMaster X-982' card into the CC2-TRAY, aligning pins perfectly\n9. Secure with original mounting screws and reconnect all labeled sensor inputs.\n\n10. Re-seal the housing and remove any tools or debris from the nacelle workspace.\n\n11. Power on the turbine and initiate diagnostic mode. Observe LED codes on the controller (expect solid green).\n\n12. Launch the WindTurbineConfig utility and run full diagnostic sync, verifying all sensor readings.\n\n13. Update the asset management system with the new controller's serial number."

The ENC-310 features anti-vibration mounts, sealed bearings, and operates with Sensor_A (angular position) and Sensor_M (motor feedback correlation) to maintain real-time alignment to wind vector.\n\n## Symptoms Indicating Encoder Issues\n\n- Incorrect yaw angle displayed in SCADA\n- Jerky or reversed nacelle movement\n- Error codes related to Sensor_A or Sensor_M\n- Intermittent loss of yaw tracking during rotation\n# Error Code Table and Remedial Actions\n\n## ENC-003\nDescription: Sensor_A signal noise exceeds 15% jitter.\nResolution: Check encoder disc for smudge or damage. Clean or replace disc. Shield signal cable from EMI.\n\n## ENC-019\nDescription: Yaw offset >5° between Sensor_A and Sensor_M.\nResolution: Recalibrate yaw zero point. Replace encoder if drift persists. Check mounting bracket stability.\n\n## ENC-025\nDescription: No signal from Sensor_M during yaw motion.\nResolution: Inspect cable routing and connector integrity. Confirm gear coupling is intact and rotating properly.\n\n## ENC-047\nDescription: Excessive vibration detected at encoder mount.\nResolution: Check anti-vibration gaskets. Torque mount bolts. Inspect for nacelle oscillation.\n\n## ENC-062\nDescription: Quadrature channel B signal missing.\nResolution: Replace encoder output cable or entire unit. Verify channel logic at SCADA diagnostics panel.\n\n## ENC-073\nDescription: Encoder temperature >70°C sustained for 10 min.\nResolution: Check for nearby heat source or airflow blockage. Replace encoder if thermal damage is observed.\n\n## ENC-091\nDescription: Unexpected direction reversals in yaw telemetry.\nResolution: Validate yaw control software version. Replace encoder if directional integrity test fails.\n\n# Inspection Cycle and Replacement Criteria\n\nInspect every 6,000 turbine hours or after abnormal yaw events. Replace encoder after 18,000 hours or if mechanical play is detected in shaft fit.\n\n# Replacement and Calibration Instructions\n\n1. Disable yaw motor from SCADA. Confirm turbine is parked and rotor is locked.\n2. Access encoder mount point on nacelle rotation base. Wear fall protection and helmet.\n3. Disconnect Sensor_A and Sensor_M signal cables from the encoder. Tag cables clearly for later reconnection.\n4. Unscrew encoder cover and inspect for dust, oil, or corrosion. Clean gently with air and optical wipes.\n5. Remove encoder disc and inspect for scratches, delamination, or misalignment. Replace if worn.\n6. Unbolt encoder housing from mount bracket. Carefully detach without damaging shaft coupling.\n7. Install new encoder onto shaft with alignment key inserted. Torque bolts to 2.5 Nm and verify fit.\n8. Reattach signal cables. Check for intact shielding and tight terminals. Avoid crossing wires.\n9. Reconnect encoder to yaw controller. Reboot module and verify SCADA detects encoder with no error.\n10. Run yaw test: rotate nacelle ±15° and compare SCADA angle with mechanical markings.\n11. Confirm directionality, jitter level <5%, and yaw-motor sync with sensor_M telemetry.\n12. Record encoder serial, install timestamp, and temperature during test cycle.\n13. Log calibration values and verify yaw alignment is within tolerance. Store photos if needed.\n14. Enable yaw motor. Monitor 1-hour yaw tracking log to verify stability and correction behavior."

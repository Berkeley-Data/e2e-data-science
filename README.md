# Databricks Free Edition: An End-to-End Applied Data Science Workflow
## Academic Presentation Summary for Berkeley Immersion Students

### Overview
This session presents an end-to-end demonstration using the recently launched Databricks Free Edition, a no-cost, non-commercial use version of the Databricks platform for students, educators, and hobbyists. The entire workflow showcases how to seamlessly build and operationalize both traditional Machine Learning (ML) and agentic solutions, leveraging open-source integrations. The demo is hands-on, with live code and direct GitHub repo integration in-session.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Experience Databricks’ modern open platform from data ingestion through productionization
- Understand open standards, open source, and cloud-native best practices in a reproducible, academic context
- Explore both declarative data engineering and agentic orchestration patterns

### End-to-End Workflow Components
1. Free Account Setup
Step-by-step walk-through of signing up for Databricks Free Edition
Direct GitHub code repository connection and synchronization within the Databricks workspace
2. Data Ingestion & ETL Pipeline Construction
Selection and exploration of a publicly available dataset
Visual ETL transformation with Lakeflow Designer, demonstrating pipeline construction
Compatibility with Spark Declarative Pipelines and open-source workflow standards
3. Open Data Governance with Unity Catalog
Data wrangling and cleansing workflows
Creating and managing a Unity Catalog (open source) for structured, secured, and discoverable data assets
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Interactive EDA using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) within Databricks notebooks
Additional EDA techniques using Genie integration for rapid data insight generation
5. Machine Learning & Agentic Workflows
Feature engineering and baseline ML model development using open source libraries
Orchestration and management with MLflow 3.0, including experiment tracking and model evaluation (open source)
Introduction to agentic workflows—demonstrating orchestration with agents alongside traditional ML pipelines
6. Model Deployment & Open Standards Access
Promotion of the trained ML model to an endpoint for consumption
Registration and access to the model via MCP (Model Connectivity Protocol) adhering to open standards
7. Interactive Application Integration
Development of an interactive Databricks App using JavaScript (Streamlit or React)
Real-time demonstration of agentic solution interaction, powered by the deployed ML endpoint

### Academic Relevance
This demo encapsulates the state-of-the-art in reproducible, open science workflows, from raw data through actionable endpoints. Graduate students gain practical experience with both engineering and applied data science lifecycles, all accessible at no cost on the Databricks Free Edition. The approach fosters both technical competence and confidence to build and share robust, production-grade analytics and agentic solutions.
